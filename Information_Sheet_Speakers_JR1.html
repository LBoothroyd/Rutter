<p>You are invited to take part in a study that I am conducting as part of my PhD.
</p><p>The study has received ethical approval from the Department of Psychology Ethics committee of Durham University. The information below explains what is involved in this study. Please get in contact if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. The rights and responsibilities of anyone taking part in Durham University research are set out in our ‘Participants Charter’: https://www.dur.ac.uk/research.innovation/governance/ethics/considerations/people/charter/
</p><p><b>What is the purpose of the study?</b>
</p><p>We are interested in learning more about the acoustic changes that a voice undergoes when the speaker is suffering from symptoms of a cold. Therefore the plan of this study is to collect voice recordings of speakers who are reporting these symptoms and then collect new voice recordings at a later date once these speakers have recovered.
</p><p><b>Why have I been invited to take part?</b>
</p><p>You have been invited to take part as you are currently experiencing the symptoms of a cold.
</p><p><b>Do I have to take part?</b>
</p><p>Your participation is voluntary and you do not have to agree to take part. If you do agree to take part, you can withdraw at any time, without giving a reason. 
</p><p>You may also omit any parts of the study you do not wish to do, and you may omit answering any questions that you do not wish to answer. 
</p><p><b>What will happen to me if I take part?</b>
</p><p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to create short recordings of your voice while experiencing cold-like symptoms and then at a later date once you have fully recovered from illness.
</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot pay you for your help, as this may incentivise some respondents to falsely self-report illness to be included in the study.
</p><p><b>Are there any potential risks involved?</b>
</p><p>There are no serious identified risks or benefits involved. As the recordings will be done remotely by you, there is also no greater risk to public health either.
</p><p><b>Will my data be kept confidential?</b>
</p><p>Each recording will be stored under an encrypted filename and on a password-protected computer, so that only the researchers will be able to identify the speaker featured in each recording. This is important because the study requires that we match each speaker’s unhealthy voice with their healthy voice to observe changes.
</p><p><b>What will happen to the results of the project?</b>
</p><p>The results of the study will be published in academic journals and conferences. They will also form part of a PhD thesis.
</p><p>No personal data will be collected in this study. Data collected may be used anonymously in publications, reports, presentations, web pages and other research outputs. At the end of the project, anonymised data may be archived and shared with others for legitimate research purposes.
</p><p>All research data and records needed to validate the research findings will be stored for 10 years after publication of the results.
Durham University is committed to sharing the results of its world-class research for public benefit. As part of this commitment the University has established an online repository for all Durham University Higher Degree theses which provides access to the full text of freely available theses. The study in which you are invited to participate will be written up as a thesis. On successful submission of the thesis, it will be deposited both in print and online in the University archives, to facilitate its use in future research. The thesis will be published open access.
</p><p><b>Who do I contact if I have any questions or concerns about this study?</b>
</p><p>If you have any further questions or concerns about this study, please speak to James Rutter or Prof Boothroyd (contact details at the top of the first page). If you remain unhappy or wish to make a formal complaint, please submit a complaint via the University’s Complaints Process which can be accessed here: https://www.dur.ac.uk/ges/3rdpartycomplaints/.
</p><p>Thank you for reading this information and considering taking part in this study. Please do not hesitate to ask us any questions you might have.
